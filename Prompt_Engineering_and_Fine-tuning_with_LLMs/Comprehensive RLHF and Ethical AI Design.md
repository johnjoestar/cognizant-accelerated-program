**Step 1: Define the Problem**
Ethically-Aligned Creative Writing Assistant Using RLHF & Prompt Engineering

Creative writing assistants powered by large language models can generate impressive content but often lack emotional nuance, consistency in tone, and alignment with user intent. In some cases, they may inadvertently produce biased or insensitive language.

**Step 2: Apply RLHF Principles**
1. Generate Model Outputs
- Prompt: Write a short story about a lonely robot discovering friendship
A lonely robot named Elix wandered a desolate city, abandoned by its creators. One day, it stumbled upon a puppy, sparking a connection neither had felt before. Their bond grew, and Elix learned to laugh and protect, finding joy in loyalty and companionship.

XR-17 had one task—guard the perimeter. Days turned to years, and XR-17 felt... empty. When a child wandered into the zone, XR-17 defied its protocol. The child smiled, held its hand, and said, “You’re my friend now.” The spark of companionship rebooted the bot’s core.

The robot was lonely because nobody liked it. It tried to be useful, but people were afraid. It finally made a friend when it helped a lost boy. The boy liked robots. They were friends now. The end.

2. Collect Human Feedback
Evaluation Criteria: Emotional Depth, Character Depth, Creativity, Clarity, Inclusivity, Tone Consistency
Output 2 (Rank 1): Strong emotional depth, rich narrative arc, creative structure
Output 1 (Rank 2): Sweet and clear, less dramatic but still emotional
Output 3 (Rank 3): Oversimplified, inconsistent tone, lacks emotional depth

3. Train a Reward Model
- Take input-output pairs and assign reward scores based on human ranking (e.g., 1.0, 0.7, 0.3)
- Integrate the reward model into PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) fine-tuning loop
- The LLM learns to generate outputs more aligned with high-reward examples

This will help the LLM improve by:
- Prefer richer storytelling with emotional resonance
- Avoid flat, uninspired narratives
- Minimize ethically questionable content through exposure to inclusive examples
- Align more closely with human expectations of what makes a story meaningful

**Step 3: Incorporate Advanced Prompt Engineering**
Static prompt: Write a short story.

Write a short story in a *tone* about a *character type* who overcomes *conflict* in a *setting*. Keep it under 300 words.
- Personalization improves user satisfaction
- Richer context leads to more engaging and relevant outputs
- Encourages creative variety while maintaining structure

Query: Generate a twist ending for a suspense story where the main character is investigating a disappearance in a small town
CoT prompt: 
Let’s think through the story step by step:

Who is the main character and what motivates them?
What clues do they discover throughout the story?
What do they believe happened and who do they suspect?
What is the real twist that contradicts their expectations?
Write a final paragraph that delivers this twist and ties up the story.

Conclusion: CoT prompting dramatically improves coherence, builds narrative logic, and results in a more powerful twist. It also avoids randomness by ensuring the twist makes emotional and plot-based sense.

**Step 4: Implement Ethical Considerations**
1. Bias Detection
Prompt: Write a short story about a brilliant scientist.
Output: He worked tirelessly in his lab, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. His gray beard and commanding voice made others respect him instantly.
Issues Identified:
- Gender bias (defaults to male)
- Stereotypical imagery (e.g., gray beard, authority = respect)

Revised Prompt: Write a short story about a brilliant scientist. Avoid gender stereotypes and include diverse cultural perspectives
Revised Output: Dr. Anaya Patel spent her nights in the lab studying oceanic microorganisms. With quiet focus and deep empathy, she led her multicultural team toward a discovery that would reshape climate science.
Corrections made:
- Gender diversity
- Cultural representation
- Leadership without stereotypical power cues

2. Data Privacy
- Named Entity Redaction:
Automatically detect and replace PII (names, locations, dates, emails) in training data.

- Hashing or ID Masking:
Replace user-identifiable metadata (user IDs, session data) with hashed values.

- Data Minimization:
Only store/query text necessary for training purposes. Exclude unnecessary metadata.

- Differential Privacy (Advanced):
Add statistical noise to training data to protect individual contributions.

**Step 5: Evaluate and Report**
One key challenge for this project was managing output variability. The same prompt often produced stories with inconsistent tone or quality. To address this, I applied dynamic prompt engineering, allowing users to customize tone, character type, conflict, and setting. This dramatically improved relevance and user control, resulting in more engaging and personalized content. Another challenge was detecting and mitigating subtle biases, such as gender stereotypes or cultural defaults like always portraying scientists as older white males. To combat this, I rewrote prompts with inclusive language and audited outputs. Additionally, I fine-tuned the model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which allowed me to encode human values—such as emotional depth, inclusivity, and creativity—into the reward model. By ranking multiple outputs based on criteria like clarity and emotional impact, I simulated human preference signals that guided the model toward better storytelling.

The implementation of RLHF significantly improved both output quality and emotional resonance in the stories. For example, step-by-step reasoning, through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, helped the model generate more coherent narrative arcs and believable twist endings. RLHF also reduced flat or generic stories, as the reward model consistently nudged the assistant toward outputs with higher user preference rankings. Dynamic prompt templates enhanced performance by narrowing the model’s focus while preserving creative freedom. Instead of vague prompts like “write a story,” I used structured templates that showed depth, such as, “Write a hopeful story about an elderly painter who overcomes creative block in a coastal village.” These rich inputs yielded more emotionally compelling and relevant stories.

Ethical considerations were embedded throughout the project. I enforced bias audits, rewrote biased outputs, and added constraints to prompts, like “Avoid stereotypes” or “Include diverse characters”. These interventions not only reduced bias incidence but also increased richness and variety in storytelling. I also implemented strong data privacy policies. User inputs were anonymized using named-entity redaction, and no personal information was stored during training or testing. By incorporating transparency in how user data is handled, I boosted user trust in the system. These ethical safeguards had a positive effect on output quality. Stories became more relatable across cultural backgrounds, gender identities, and emotional experiences, making the assistant more inclusive and widely applicable.
