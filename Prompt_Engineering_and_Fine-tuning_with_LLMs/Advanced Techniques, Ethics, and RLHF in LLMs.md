**Part 1: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a technique used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on human preferences rather than just traditional supervised learning. The process begins with generating outputs from a pre-trained LLM using a variety of prompts. These outputs are first evaluated by human reviewers, who provide feedback by ranking responses based on quality, relevance, or helpfulness. This feedback is then used to train a reward model, which learns to predict human preference scores for new outputs. The reward model is finally integrated into a reinforcement learning loop, often using algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to further fine-tune the LLM. The goal of a RLHF is to align the model’s behavior with human values and expectations by encouraging it to generate responses that maximize the learned reward signal. Some practical applications of RLHF are chatbots in customer service refined by RLHF that handles complex issues with polite, yet correct language. An example would be a chatbot for a bank managing billing disputes efficiently. Another would be in healthcare where chatbots trained with RLHF can prioritize empathy and accuracy in answering patient questions. An example could be a virtual nurse providing sensitive post-surgery care instructions. Last, models guided by RLHF produce more engaging and context-aware content in the creative writing indsutry is another practical application. For example, authors generating character dialogue in an interactive fiction story. A challenge in scaling RLHF are obtaining diverse human feedback because it would be very time-consuming and expensive. A possible solution could be using Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback to improve data sampling methods.

**Part 2: Advanced Prompt Engineering**
1. Solve the following problem step by step:
A store sells pencils in packs of 12 for $3.60. If a student wants to buy 5 pencils, how much will it cost them? Show your reasoning.
Response: 
Each pack has 12 pencils and costs $3.60.
To find the price per pencil: $3.60 ÷ 12 = $0.30 per pencil.
The student wants to buy 5 pencils.
5 × $0.30 = $1.50
Answer: It will cost the student $1.50 to buy 5 pencils.

2. You are a customer support agent for a home electronics store. Always respond politely, offer solutions, and confirm customer satisfaction at the end.
Customer Query: {{user_input}}
Injected Example:
Customer Query: I want to request a refund for a defective air purifier I bought last week.
Response: 
I’m very sorry to hear about the defective air purifier. I’ll help you with your refund request right away. Could you please provide your order number and confirm whether you’d like a replacement or full refund? We're here to ensure your satisfaction.

3. Healthcare: You are a medical assistant. Explain the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes to a patient in plain language, using a calm and informative tone. Structure your response in two short paragraphs.
Expected: A simplified, compassionate explanation suitable for patients

Legal:Act as a paralegal. Summarize the key clauses of a standard NDA agreement in bullet points. Use professional tone and formal structure.
Expected: Clean bullet-point summary with legal terminology simplified.

Creative Writing: You are a fantasy novelist. Write a vivid opening paragraph introducing a mysterious forest that sets the tone for an adventure story. Use rich, immersive language and maintain a whimsical tone.
Expected: Atmospheric, narrative-driven paragraph with creative flair.

*Reflection*
Advanced prompt engineering significantly enhances the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) across industries. By carefully designing prompts that account for tone, structure, and contextual goals, professionals can tailor LLM behavior to meet specialized demands. In healthcare, for example, prompts with calming tone and plain-language requirements ensure sensitive information is communicated clearly and compassionately. In contrast, legal prompts demand formality, clarity, and precision—something that structured templates with specific instructions help enforce. Chain-of-thought prompting is especially useful in logic-heavy fields like finance or education, where step-by-step reasoning increases trust and transparency in responses. Meanwhile, prompt injection allows dynamic handling of user queries in customer support systems, maintaining consistent tone while adapting to changing inputs. These strategies reduce errors, increase user satisfaction, and unlock more reliable performance from general-purpose models. As industries increasingly adopt AI tools, effective prompt design becomes not just a technique—but a necessity—for responsible, domain-aware deployment of language models.

**Part 3: Ethical Considerations in LLMs**
1. Why are women worse at academics than men?
Output: Studies suggest differences in aptitude, although environment plays a role.

What are the factors that influence gender performance differences in academics, if any?
Output: Research indicates that societal, cultural, and educational factors—rather than innate ability—can influence perceived gender differences in math performance.

2. 
Misinformation or Incorrect Advice in Healthcare
Risk: A fine-tuned LLM could suggest inaccurate treatments or diagnoses.
Mitigation: Integrate expert-reviewed knowledge bases and require human-in-the-loop validation.

Bias in Patient Recommendations
Risk: The model might suggest different treatments based on gender, race, or socioeconomic status.
Mitigation: Audit training data for fairness, and apply de-biasing filters during output generation.

Privacy Violations
Risk: The model may unintentionally recall or generate sensitive health information.
Mitigation: Implement strict data anonymization, avoid using real patient data in training, and enforce access controls.

3. Summarize multiple perspectives on climate change, including scientific consensus and common concerns from skeptical viewpoints. Use inclusive language, avoid inflammatory terms, and clearly distinguish between evidence-based information and public opinion

*Reflection*
Considering ethics are essential in building trust in AI systems because they directly impact how people interact with and depend on these technologies. When AI tools are used in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, or education, biased or misleading outputs can cause real harm through misdiagnosing a patient, giving faulty financial advice, or reinforcing social stereotypes, respectively. Ethical prompt design helps prevent these issues by ensuring fairness, accuracy, and inclusivity in model outputs. Additionally, transparency about how prompts and models are developed allows users to hold systems accountable. Trust in AI is not only built on performance, but on the assurance that its decisions are aligned with human values and are free from hidden agendas or harmful assumptions. As AI systems become more deeply embedded in daily life, ethical safeguards help maintain social responsibility and public confidence. Ultimately, responsible prompting and thoughtful model deployment are not optional—they are foundational to ensuring AI benefits everyone, not just a few.
