Part 1: Theory of Fine-Tuning
A real-world analogy of transfer learning would be if a medical student who spent years learning general medicine and wanting to specialize in it, but they got matched into cardiology or oncology. Instead of starting from scratch, the medical student would build upon their existing medical knowledge and focus on heart-related or cancer-related medical terminology through additional learning. A pre-trained model, like GPT-4o, already trained from vast amounts of general data. When applying this knowledge to a specific domain, like diagnosing heart disease or specific cancers, the model only needs fine-tuning with specialized data, saving time and computational resources. A general image recognition AI trained on millions of pictures can be fine-tuned with medical scans to detect tumors. Instead of training from scratch and going through all the millions of pictures again, it adapts its existing knowledge to the new task. Just as a cardiologist or oncologist levereages prior medical knowledge to specialize efficiently, transfer learning enables AI to quickly and effectively adapt to new applications with minimal data and effort.

Part 2: Practical Fine-Tuning Session
Some key challenges I faced during the fine-tuning process were data processing issues where the dataset preprocessing function lacked proper structure, so I correctly defined the def with proper indentation and also added max length for padding. Another challenge included being wary of overfitting/underfitting, since training for only 3 epochs could cause some issues, so I implemented early stopping. Even though my model was above 90%, some suggestions for improvement, nonetheless, could be hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, using a larger model, or ensemble models.
